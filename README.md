# About me
Hello. I am a secondary school teacher, and I teach the subjects Biology and Geology, German Culture and OFFICE/Computer Science. Kawum. At the beginning of the school year I was asked to set up a series of environmental measurement stations in our school, in order to measure and monitor the air quality there. It was focused as a project to be done partly with students, but with a real production purpose. To be honest, I am a mathematician, have programmed for several years, and I knew a little about Arduino, without having come to make any project until that moment, only some workshop of lighting leds. At the beginning I found it quite a simple task. I knew that measuring the temperature is one of the first exercises you learn with Arduino. 
I started on my own with a WeMos board, borrowed from a friend, and a DHT11 sensor, uploading the data via WiFi to https://thingspeak.com/.
Things got complicated when I was told that many other values had to be measured as well, ... I didn't know where to go anymore, as I couldn't find simple shields that could measure all those values. And I found myself unable to weld a single wire, let alone with students.
I asked for help from the experts, and was led back to the world of arduino plates, mkr1010 plates, with environmental shields, and GrooveConnector. As sensors, those of Seedstudio to 3.3V. The sensors are plug and play
